  Given pixel data for images and several feature functions that can operate on
  single images, apply all feature functions to all images, concatenating the
  feature vectors for each image and storing the features for all images in
  a single matrix.

  Inputs:
  - imgs: N x H X W X C array of pixel data for N images.
  - feature_fns: List of k feature functions. The ith feature function should
    take as input an H x W x D array and return a (one-dimensional) array of
    length F_i.
  - verbose: Boolean; if true, print progress.

  Returns:
  An array of shape (N, F_1 + ... + F_k) where each column is the concatenation
